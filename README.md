# Budget_Calculator
A simple budget calculator used for budgeting, and tracking spending.

The program takes a given monthly income (which you have to set in the Ops class) and the ratio of your income you wish to allocate to,
Expenses, Savings, Investments, and Particulars/Emergencies.

By default the income is set to 5K a month with:

  Expenses: 50%
  Savings: 40%
  Investment: 5%
  Particulars/Emergencies: 5%

The process:
  You create a txt file where you will create a entry with a transaction choice of:
    E: Expense
    S: Savings
    I: Investment
    P: Particulars/Emergency
  
 In the transaction text box a user would insert a 'transaction' such as:
  
   E,Spotify,10.00,1/4/2020
    
 Then specify the path to the txt file where they wrote their transaction down by the 'Choose File' button.
  
 After that, the user will be able to calculate their budget.
